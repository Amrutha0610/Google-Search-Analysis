# Google Search Analysis with Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to **analyze Google search queries** programmatically using Python.  
It explores how to fetch search trends, process and clean the data, and visualize useful insights.  
The project was inspired by a tutorial on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and further customized for learning purposes.

Key functionalities include:
- Automating Google search analysis
- Extracting search result information
- Visualizing search trends and patterns
- Practicing data cleaning and analysis in Python

---

## ✨ Features
- Fetch and analyze search results for custom keywords  
- Clean and preprocess data for better visualization  
- Generate plots showing search frequency and trends  
- imple, lightweight code — perfect for learning automation and data analysis

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- `pandas` — Data handling  
- `matplotlib` — Data visualization  
- `requests` / `beautifulsoup4` — Web scraping (if applicable)  
- `pytrends` — Google Trends API (optional)

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Amrutha0610/google-search-analysis.git
cd google-search-analysis

```
### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

``` bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
```

## How to Run
### Option 1: Google Colab
Upload the notebook to Google Colab
Run each cell sequentially

### Option 2: Local Jupyter Notebook
``` bash
jupyter notebook Google_Search_Analysis_with_Python.ipynb
```
Run through the notebook to:
- Enter keywords
- Fetch search data
- Clean and visualize the results

## What I Learned
- Using Python libraries for web scraping and trends analysis
- Cleaning and preprocessing textual data
- Plotting and visualizing search results effectively
- Structuring and documenting projects professionally
